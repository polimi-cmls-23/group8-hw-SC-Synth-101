<h1>Multieffect Synth101</h1>
 <p>Implementation of a multi effect with phaser, flanger and wah wah, whose layout is arrangeable in custom order. To bypass a filter it is only necessary to switch off the button at the bottom of each pedal. Frequency and time plots of both input and output signals are also implemented. The code can be simply executed by running the brackets at lines: 1, 7, 20, 135. To run the code a second time it is sufficient to run only the piece of code from line 135 onward. The first following picture shows the GUI when the frequency scope is selected, while the second one instead illustrates it on the time plot mode. </p>

 <h3>Phaser</h3>
 <div>Frequency knob: Frequency of a sinusoidal wave that modulates the delay of an all-pass filter.</div>
 <div>Dry/wet knob: Sets how heavy the phaser effect is with respect to the input signal.</div>
 
 <h3>Flanger</h3>
 <div>Frequency knob: Controls the frequency of the LFO that influences the delay time</div>
 <div>Feedback knob: Sets the amount of feedback</div>
 <div>Width knob: Sets the amplitude of the LFO described before</div>
 <div>Dry/wet knob: Sets how heavy the flanger effect is with respect to the input signal</div>
 
 <h3>Wah wah</h3>
 <div>Frequency knob: Sets the frequency of the wah effect </div>
 <div>Dry/wet knob: Sets how heavy the wah wah effect is with respect to the input signal</div>
 
 <h3>General settings</h3>
 <p>It is possible to control the master volume, the pan and the overall ON/OFF from the respective knobs and button, whereas the arrows permit to swap pedal order.</p>
