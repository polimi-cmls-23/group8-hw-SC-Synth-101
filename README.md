# Multi effect Synth 101

Implementation of a multi effect with phaser, flanger and wah-wah disposable in custom order.
Effects feature also a bypass mode. A Frequency view of input and output signals was also implemented.

The code can be simply be executed by running the code contained in the three parethesis at lines: 7, 14, 109.
To run the code a second time it is sufficient to run only the piece of code from line 109 onward.

A picture of the Multi effect and a description of its funtionalities is given below:
